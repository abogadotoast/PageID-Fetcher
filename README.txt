# PageID-Fetcher
This is a pageID fetcher for UNR.edu. On any unr.edu webpage, simply press Ctrl-Shift-Z and you should be able to fetch the pageID. This improves the workflow of editing articles in our CMS, so I strongly recommend sharing this addon.
Let me know what you guys think of the code and if you want, please submit changes that improve it.


Files required for successful Google Chrome compilation from the Github link:
manifest.json // basically a Google Chrome make file
pageid.html // an HTML file that is displayed upon clicking the addon button
pageidsearch.js // the Javascript which controls the information gathering logic
mystyles.css // a blank CSS file so Chrome doesnâ€™t cry
